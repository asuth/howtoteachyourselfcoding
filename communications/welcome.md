Hello, and welcome to the How to Teach Yourself Coding course! I’m your instructor, Andrew Sutherland.

Tomorrow is our first class! Here are actions you need to take before class: 
1. Take this [pre-class survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScriqTY2MAW_l2tKAFCh0bhfelS071F2WFsFA9jymEI6cnSig/viewform?usp=sf_link) (required, should take 2 minutes).
2. Sign up for Repl.it’s [hacker plan](https://repl.it/site/pricing) ($5/mo) if you haven’t already. We will be checking the class roster against the paid subscriber list tomorrow (you must use the same email for both). If you signed up for the $100 invoice, we'll contact you.

A few things to note:
1. This will be a live, interactive class. That means you’ll have the opportunity to ask real-time questions and share code you get stuck on. If you can’t make it to a live class, no problem -- we’ll release the video afterwards.
2. The class will be hosted on Zoom. We will be writing code on Repl.it. A zoom invite link will be sent to you by email before the class.
3. Reminder: this is a beginner class! No previous coding experience is needed.

Class begins at 4pm PDT every Monday, Wednesday, Friday for the month of August. Classes will be 1 hour long, but we will hold the room open for 30 more minutes for questions and discussions.

More to come shortly!
-Andrew
